# Task 2 - Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Welcome to my submission for **Task 2** of the Data Science Internship at **Skill Craft**. In this task, I have performed **Data Cleaning** and **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **Titanic dataset** from Kaggle. The goal was to explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this task is the **Titanic dataset**, which contains information on passengers aboard the Titanic. The dataset includes features such as passenger class, age, sex, fare, survival status, and more.

## Tools and Libraries used
- **Jupyter notebook**
- **Pandas**
- **Numpy**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization

## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
During the EDA process, I performed the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Checked for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies in the dataset. Handled missing data through imputation or removal as necessary.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: 
   - Analyzed the relationships between key variables like age, sex, passenger class, and survival status.
   - Visualized the distribution of variables using plots such as histograms, bar charts, and correlation matrices.
   - Identified potential patterns and trends in the data, such as survival rates by class, age group, and gender.

## Conclusion
This EDA process helped uncover important relationships between variables and provided insights into the factors that may have influenced the survival rates on the Titanic. These findings can guide further modeling and analysis to predict survival chances based on passenger features.

Thank you for reviewing my submission!
